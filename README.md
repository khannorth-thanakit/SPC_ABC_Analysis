# SPC_ABC_Analysis
Data Cleansing &amp; ABC Classification Group Analysis for Spare Parts Inventory

Goal/Objective: To improve inventory management efficiency and reduce costs by performing data cleansing on a spare parts dataset, followed by ABC classification to group parts based on their value contribution.

## Technologies Used:
- Python: Pandas (for data manipulation, cleaning, analysis), Matplotlib/Seaborn (for visualization).
- Excel (for initial data state).

### Key Analysis & Visualizations:
ABC Classification: Applied the ABC classification method to categorize spare parts based on their cumulative value contribution.
Value Distribution (Pareto Chart): The accompanying Pareto Chart clearly illustrates the distribution:
- Class A (4.8% of items): These represent a very small percentage of the total number of spare parts but typically account for the highest cumulative value (though the chart doesn't explicitly state the value percentage, this is the principle of ABC).
- Class B (11.4% of items): A moderate number of items contributing to a middle tier of value.
- Class C (83.8% of items): The vast majority of spare parts, which collectively account for the lowest cumulative value.
### Implications: This analysis provides critical insights for optimized inventory strategies. For instance, it suggests that efforts for tight control and frequent monitoring should be primarily focused on the small number of high-value 'A' items, while 'C' items might be managed with less stringent control due to their lower individual impact.
